            <p>
                In Palau, many people own a plot of land. In most cases, it is currently
                undeveloped but there are some exception. The exceptions being, there are some land that started or have finished development
                in one way or another. On top of that, Palauans can own land in
                Palau while foreigners can only lease the land for 99 years. I want to
                address both of this problems! I want to make a web application that
                would allow Palauans to sell (optionally lease) their land amongst
                themselves and only lease it to foreigners. This implies two things: I
                want to expose Palau's land locally and internationally because Palau's
                real estate is currently nonexistent: I want to start the growth of
                Palau's real estate market because a USA military base will be established soon and thus, Palau's
                population will boom.

        <h2>Why Real Estate Palau?</h2>
        <p>
            Palau real estate web application's purpose is to allow Palauans to
            start selling their land locally and internationally: ignite the growth
            of the real estate market and create another source of cash flow in Palau
