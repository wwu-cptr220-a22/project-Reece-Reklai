        <p>
          In Palau, many people own a plot of land. In most cases, it is
          currently undeveloped. Furthermore, Palau has a unique law that
          prevents foreigners from owning land. This means that Palauans can
          only buy and sell land to one another. In order to include foreigners,
          Palauans can lease their land for 99 years to them. To make matters
          worse, there will be a huge population increase in a few years because
          USA is in the process of establishing a base in one of Palau's states.
          Currently, there is no system in place that faciliates transaction
          between Palauans as well as foreigners. This website answers these
          problems. Welcome to Palau Real Estate! Here, the website allows the
          click of a button where both problems are taken into account and
          handled for you!
