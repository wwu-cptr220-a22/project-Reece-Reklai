      <h2>Topic Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Are you going to buy a new home or land? This is an important question
        to consider as we grow up, a place to settle for yourself: possibly, a
        home for your future family. Real estate allows you to purchase such a
        transaction. This means that you can find a plot of land to build your
        own home or start with a home that has already built. Either way, the
        location of your choice determines on the luxury you get to enjoy. A
        home near a beach allows you to enjoy hot summer time or one near the
        mountains where you can expect amazing views and hikes during fall and
        spring: even in winter you get to snowboard! The power to buy a domain
        under your name allows you to enjoy its amenities while being under the
        protection against the four seasons and the public eye. If that is not
        enough, the purchase can be used as an investment to sell later down the
        road or allow other people to rent it. The benefits outweigh the cons
        in this case and thus, why real estate is such a sought out investment.
        If investment is not your concern, real estate will at least give you a
        home to settle down in.

        In Palau, many people own a plot of land. In most cases, it is currently
        undeveloped but there are some exception where there is some sort of
        development that had occurred. On top of that, Palauans can own land in
        Palau while foreigners can only lease the land for 99 years. I want to
        address both of this problems! I want to make a web application that
        would allow Palauans to sell (optionally lease) their land amongst
        themselves and only lease it to foreigners. This implies two things: I
        want to expose Palau's land locally and internationally because Palau's
        real estate is currently nonexistent: I want to start the growth of
        Palau's real estate market.

      <h3>Application's Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Palau real estate web application's purpose is to allow Palauans to
        start selling their land locally and internationally: start the growth
        of Palau real estate market.

      <h4>Application's Potential</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Palauans can list their land on the website</li>
        <li>
          Use a google map api to show the dimensions of the land while also
          being able to view it
        </li>
        <li>
          User create an account so that they can buy, sell, and lease land
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt>Facilitate the transaction between the buyer and seller</dt>
        <dd>
          If it is sold to foreigners then the transaction only occurs once the
          foreigners signs a contract that it can only be leased once every 99
          years (renewing is possible)
        </dd>
        <dd>
          Keep track of the lease's current state (how much time is remaining on
          the contract: year remaining, month remaining, and day remaining)
        </dd>
      </dl>

          I am not sure if there is an API that keep track of remaining year,
          month, and day after the lease has started
